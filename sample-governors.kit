<p class="lead">As a Foundation Trust, King’s has a Council of Governors which ensures that the key stakeholders – patients, members of the public, staff and partner organisations – have a say in shaping their local health service.</p>

<p>Collectively, it represents the interests of the more than 20,000 people who have become a Member of King&#8217;s. Our membership is made up of patients, staff and members of the public, and it gives us valuable insight and perspective. Our Members also have other important roles as part of the governance structure of the Trust, such as appointing Non-Executive Directors.</p> 

<p>Our governors are elected and appointed from across four constituencies:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="javascript:void(0)">Public governors</a> represent each of our local constituencies.</li>

<li><a href="javascript:void(0)">Patient governors</a> represent King&#8217;s College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust patients, including those who live outside the constituencies we serve.</li>

<li><a href="javascript:void(0)">Staff governors</a> represent a variety of staff roles across the Trust.</li>

<li><a href="javascript:void(0)">Nominated governors</a> are the appointed representatives of our stakeholder organisations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Council of Governors meetings</h2>

<p>Our Council of Governors meets four times a year. Two of these meetings will be held at our Denmark Hill site. The other two meetings will be held in Bromley, at a venue to be confirmed. These meetings are open to the public and we also encourage our Members to attend.</p>

<p>If you have a question you would like to put to the Board of Directors/Council of Governors, please email it to the Foundation Trust Office on kch-tr.FTO@nhs.net. In your email, please state at which meeting you would like your question to be asked in the subject line.</p>
