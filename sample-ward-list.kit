<h1>Wards A&#8211;Z</h1>

<p class="lead">We want to ensure you receive the best possible care. That includes having the right levels of nursing and midwifery staff at all times during your stay.</p>

<p>All wards provide single-sex accommodation, bathroom and toilet facilities. Flowers are not allowed on any wards due to infection control issues. Please do not bring in valuable items (eg laptops, mobile phones, jewellery) or large sums of money as the Trust cannot accept liability for the loss of items. Please read our section on security for more advice on how to keep your valuables safe.</p>
