<!-- $pattern-example-long Over the last 170 years, King&#8217;s has built its reputation as a world class hospital, with roots that lie firmly in the heart of our community. We are both a leading teaching hospital and a local hospital with a diverse inner city population. Our vision is to become a fundamentally new kind of hospital built around patient need, offering all our patientsâ€”local, national and international&#8212;the highest quality of care, and to deliver this as part of a joined-up and well&#8217;managed healthcare system, built in partnership with GPs and other healthcare providers.
