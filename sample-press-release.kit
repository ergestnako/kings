<h1>King&#8217;s research on implants published in BDJ</h1>
<p class="lead">14 April 2015: Three-part study examines potential risk, prevention and management of implant gum disease</p>

<p>Peri-implantitis&#8212;a little known infection that causes loss of bone following dental implants&#8212;is presenting an increasing problem for the dental profession, according to a King&#8217;s College Hospital study published in the British Dental Journal.</p>

<p>Dental implants were first introduced back in the 1980s, but are now cheaper and more affordable, and used widely in both primary and secondary care. They are used to replace teeth lost through trauma or severe decay.</p>

<p>The review&#8212;led by Dr Aws Alani, Consultant Restorative Dentist at King&#8217;s College Hospital&#8212;represents one of the first, in-depth analyses into peri-implantitis, and its aetiology, prevalence and diagnostic features.</p> 

<p>With dental implants growing in popularity, Dr Alani&#8217;s research shows that more needs to be done to ensure effective prevention and management of peri-implantitis, which causes infection and, in severe cases, can lead to the implant being removed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dental implants are a positive development, and are proving popular with patients, as well as high-street and hospital dentists. We use them regularly here at King&#8217;s. At the same time, the growing number of patients we are diagnosing with peri-implantitis shows that there are risks, which need to be managed and clearly explained to patients undergoing this procedure.&#8221;</p>
